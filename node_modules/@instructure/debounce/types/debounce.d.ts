/**
 * ---
 * category: utilities
 * ---
 * Creates a debounced function that delays invoking func until after wait milliseconds have elapsed
 * since the last time the debounced function was invoked. The debounced function comes with a cancel
 * method to cancel delayed func invocations and a flush method to immediately invoke them. Provide options
 * to indicate whether func should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the wait timeout.
 * The func is invoked with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent calls to the
 * debounced function return the result of the last func invocation.
 *
 * [lodash.debounce](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/debounce.js)
 * doesn't work well with [sinon fakeTimers](http://sinonjs.org/releases/v1.17.7/fake-timers/)
 * so this is forked from the lodash source.
 *
 * Note: Modified from the original to check for cancelled boolean before invoking func to prevent React setState
 * on unmounted components.
 * @module debounce
 *
 * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.
 * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.
 * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.
 * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]
 *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.
 * @param {number} [options.maxWait]
 *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.
 * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]
 *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.
